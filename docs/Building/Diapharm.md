# Diaphragm

## What is diaphragm?
- In structural engineering, a diaphragm is a horizontal structural element — usually a floor slab or roof deck — 
- diapharm transfers lateral loads (like wind or earthquake forces) to the vertical resisting elements such as shear walls, braced frames, or moment-resisting frames.

## Types of diaphragm
- Rigid
  - diaphragm with infinite stiffness
  - In ETABS we usually go with rigid diaphragm to reduce computation time
  - In ETABS horizontal forces will get applied at center of mass 
- Semi Rigid
  - diaphragm with finite stiffness
  - With semi-rigid diaphragm we need to provide stiffness but in reality it provides similar results to rigid diapharms
