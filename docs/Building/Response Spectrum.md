# What is it?
- It's This is a fundamental concept in structural analysis to estimate how building or structure will respond to round motion using earthquake.
- In simple terms it will tell you that, If building had certain stiffness and damping, how much it will shake during specific earthquake.

# How to use it?
- IT's graph of Time period vs max acceleration for Specific Structure Stiffneess at specific earthquake
- So using this graph you can get max acceleration at specific time frame
- we can use this max acceleration to calculate seismic force for our building

{: .note }
In practice we don't need to generate this graph manually, we can use design code which gives use response spectrucm based on location and soil type
