# What is it?
- In normal analysis, geometry of structure don't change when applying forces. 
- So Internal forces are computed using original geometry.
- But in reality, when structure deflects, loads act on deformed shape, producing secondary moment and increased stresses.
- This is called `P-Delta` effect, here P = Axial load acting on structure and Delta = Lateral displacement

$$M = P \times \Delta$$
  
# Types of P-Delta effects
- GLobal P-Delta effect
  - Overall lateral sway of the entire structure
  - for example wind load on tall building
- Local P-Delta effect
  - Local bending of individual members
  - Column bending between floors
