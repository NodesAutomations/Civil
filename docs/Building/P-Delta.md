# What is it?
- In normal analysis, geometry of structure don't change when applying forces. 
- So Internal forces are computed using original geometry.
- But in reality, when structure deflects, loads act on deformed shape, producing secondary moment and increased stresses.
- This is called `P-Delta` effect, here P = Axial load acting on structure and Delta = Lateral displacement
- $M = P *  \Delta$
