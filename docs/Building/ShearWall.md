## ShearWall
- Vertical structure in building to resist lateral forces
- These later forces can be wind loads, earthquake loads, or sometimes ground pressure.
- Transfer Loads directly to foundation

## Purpose
- Resit Lateral loads
  - Reduce swaying due to wind or earthquake.
- Increase Stiffness
  - Makes structure more rigid
  - reduce horizontal deflection, story drift, Vibration and shaking
- Prevent structural failure
  - They prevent overturning, sliding, soft storey collapse
- Partially Carry Gravity loads
  - Support Floor loads, wall loads, roof loads specially when placed around lift and staircases
 
## Placement
- Around lift cores
- Around Staircase cores
- Buildign parameter
- Some more places to avoid torsion

## When we need it?
- High rise buildings
- Building in earthquake zones
- Building with large openings (Glass Facade)
- Structures with irregular geometry
